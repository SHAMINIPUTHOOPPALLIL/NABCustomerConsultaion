NAB Check uses predictive analytics to send early warning notifications linked with personalised
educational resources to NAB small business customers at risk of financial hardship. Guided by
continued research and consultation with small business owners and industry experts, NAB Check has
been iteratively developed to streamline the existing existing resources and channels of National
Australian Bank (NAB) in order to save unnecessary expenditure for both for NAB customers and for the
bank itself and increase financial literacy. The following business model will detail why NAB Check is a
uniquely valuable investment, how it is serving the needs of small business, how the service will work
and techniques and processes of validation used throughout.
